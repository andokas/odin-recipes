    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Marmitako</strong> is a traditional Basque fisherman's stew that originated in the coastal regions of Northern Spain. This hearty dish combines fresh tuna with potatoes, peppers, and onions in a rich, flavorful broth. Originally cooked by Basque sailors on their boats using a <em>marmita</em> (cooking pot), it's now a beloved comfort food perfect for cold days.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs fresh tuna steaks, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>2 lbs potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
        <li>2 large onions, sliced</li>
        <li>2 red bell peppers, cut into strips</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 ripe tomatoes, grated (discard skins)</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 tsp sweet paprika (piment√≥n dulce)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cups fish stock or water</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the sofrito:</strong> Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or casserole over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook for 5 minutes until softened.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Add peppers and garlic:</strong> Add the red pepper strips and minced garlic. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Add tomatoes and spices:</strong> Add the grated tomatoes, bay leaf, and paprika. Cook for 5-8 minutes until the tomatoes break down and create a thick base.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Add potatoes:</strong> Add the potato chunks to the pot and stir gently to coat with the sofrito. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Add liquid:</strong> Pour in the fish stock or water until it just covers the potatoes. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Check potatoes:</strong> Test the potatoes with a fork - they should be almost tender but still hold their shape.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Add tuna:</strong> Gently add the tuna chunks to the pot. Do not stir too much to avoid breaking the fish. Cook for 8-10 minutes until the tuna is just cooked through.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Final seasoning:</strong> Taste and adjust salt and pepper. Remove the bay leaf.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Rest and serve:</strong> Let the marmitako rest for 5 minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley and serve hot with crusty bread.</li>
